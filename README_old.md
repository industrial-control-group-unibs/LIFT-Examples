# LIFT EXAMPLE


You need to download/clone the following repositories:

- [DYNAMICAL MODEL](https://github.com/industrial-control-group-unibs/IMOCO_LIFT_MODEL)  

- [CONTROL AND MOTION PLANNING](https://github.com/industrial-control-group-unibs/IMOCO-Lift-Motion-Law)


There are two examples: 

- test.slx  runs the complete simulator (motion planning, control, dynamic model)

- test_no_ctrl.slx runs the model with only the motion planning and the kinematic model

You have to load the data running load_data.m
